# Ino-Files

These are the files that i have used for each of the Ardinuo's.  They are all Mega's except for the Video Control Panel which i use a Leonardo as it is a HID device.  The hex files are for the Tekcreation Panels.  These were supplied by Tekcreations for my versions of the hardware.  Please note that I use the FlightPanels version of DCS Bios.
